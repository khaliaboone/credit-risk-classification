# credit-risk-classification
In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict the risk level of loans based on historical lending data. The goal is to classify loans as either "healthy" (0) or "high-risk" (1) using a logistic regression model. The dataset consists of various features about the loans, including information about the borrowers and loan status. We preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and then train the model on the training data. Finally, we evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
The logistic regression model performs well overall, achieving an accuracy of 82%. It is particularly effective at predicting healthy loans (class 0), but it struggles more with high-risk loans (class 1), where it misses some of the true positives. The model's precision and recall for class 0 are strong, but there's room for improvement in identifying high-risk loans, as shown by the lower recall for class 1. Despite this, the model provides a solid foundation and can be further improved by using techniques like balancing the dataset or adjusting model parameters.
I was able to create this code with the help from CHATGPT as well as previous tutoring sessions. I credit them both to the sucess of this code.
